# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a multipage portfolio website showcasing my key assignments from Noroffâ€™s Frontend Development courses second year. The portfolio highlights three main projects: CSS Frameworks (BLUB), JavaScript Frameworks (CART), and Semester Project 2 (ReUze).

The goal was to revisit and improve these projects while demonstrating a clean, responsive, and professional frontend design. The site provides teaser cards linking to detailed project pages and includes live site links, GitHub links, and share/copy functionality.

# Description
Portfolio 2 is a personal multipage portfolio website designed to present my main projects from my second school year, with polished layouts and clear navigation. The homepage features teaser cards for each project, while individual project pages provide detailed descriptions, images, live site links, and GitHub repository links.

The portfolio emphasizes responsive design, usability, and accessibility.

### Key features include:
- Homepage with teaser cards: Each project card includes a thumbnail, title, short description, and links to the article page.
- Individual project pages: Detailed description, project screenshots, live site link, GitHub link, and share/copy link functionality.
- Live site links: All projects include links opening in a new tab for easy access.
- Responsive design: Fully mobile-friendly layout with Tailwind CSS styling.
- Polished UX: Hover effects, subtle shadows, and clear typography for improved readability.
- Reusable components: Shared components such as ImageGallery and Toast for consistency across pages.

### Learning Outcomes:
Through the development of this project, I have demonstrated the following skills:

- Planning and structuring a multipage React website.
